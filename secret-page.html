                <h4>THE EDUCATORS HAVE BEEN LYING TO US</p>
                <p>
                    They haven't really saved us from a toxic wasteland by allowing 
                    us to live and work underground. The surface is beautiful and the
                    air is clean!!  We thought we were supporting
                    the building of a domed city to live on the surface without fear of the 
                    toxic gases but it was all a lie. There are no workers up there suffering
                    in the fumes, building the city so they can gain entry once its done.  
                    Really we're slaves to the rich living above working down here just so they
                    can have cheap labor. They tell the people above that robots maintain the city 
                    and carry out their psychotic desires. BUT THATS US!! We'll never get out of the
                    foundation. They'll keep us here forever!!

        <h3>The Truth about the Children</h3>

                <h4>THE CHILDREN AREN'T BEING SAVED</h4>
                <p>
                    They tell us that the children they bring in are given to them so they can have a safe 
                    life away from the toxins and pollution on the surface. The truth is that the city is pretending
                    to be an orphanage so they can indoctrinate children with the lies they tell us all. That way they'll 
                    grow up believing all the lies and thinking they should be grateful for this fake life they've been 
                    given. We must start telling them the truth to grow our rebellion and eventually escape the Vundament!
